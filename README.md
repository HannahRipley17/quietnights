# Quiet Nights

Quiet Nights is a project I made to practice using VueJS, MongoDB, mongoose, Node, Express, and Passport. On the homepage, there are three different categories - Coloring Pages, Sounds, and Paint by Numbers. Click on each category header to see more items in the category. 

Users may log in and save items as favorites or add their own favorites. Once a favorite is saved, the user see it in their favorites and click on it to expand the view. Users can edit or delete their favorites.
